I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Software and Theory department at the School of Computer Science, Peking University. My undergraduate degree is in Software Engineering from Soochow University.

I am extremely privileged to be under the guidance of Professor Li Ge at Peking University's School of Computer Science. My research interests are centered around ensuring software quality, leveraging large language models for coding (LLM4Code), and related areas in computer science.
